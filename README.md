# Interactive Image Retrieval Based On Content And Textual Feedback
## Introduction

One of the peculiar features of human perception is multi-modality. We unconsciously attach attributes to objects, which can sometimes uniquely identify them. 
For instance, when a person says apple, it is quite natural that an image of an apple, which may be green or red in color, forms in their mind. 
In information retrieval, the user seeks information from a retrieval system by sending a query. Traditional information retrieval systems allow a unimodal query, i.e., either a text or an image.

## Teaser Figure

Advanced information retrieval systems should enable the users in expressing the concept in their mind by allowing a multi-modal query.

In this work, we consider such an advanced retrieval system, where users can retrieve images from a database based on a multi-modal (image-text) query. 
Specifically, the query text prompts some modification in the query image and the task is to retrieve images with the desired modifications. This task has applications in the domain of E-Commerce search, surveillance systems and internet search.

The figure shows a potential application scenario of this task.
In this figure a user of an E-Commerce platform is interested in buying a dress, which should look similar to her friendâ€™s dress, but the dress should has striped design and is more covered on the neck. In this case, we would like the algorithm to retrieve some dresses with desired modifications in the query dress. 

## ComposeAE Architecture 
We propose an autoencoder based model, to learn the composition of image and text query
for retrieving images. We adopt a deep metric learning approach and learn a metric that pushes composition
of source image and text query closer to the target images. We also used a rotational symmetry constraint
on the optimization problem.

## Results
Our approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-art method TIRG and ComposeAE on a benchmark dataset, namely: MIT-States.

## Requirements and Installation
* Packages can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)


## Description of the Code [(From ComposeAE)](https://github.com/ecom-research/ComposeAE/blob/master/README.md)
The code is based on ComposeAE code. 
Several significant changes have been made.

- `main.py`: driver script to run training/testing
- `datasets.py`: Dataset classes for loading images & generate training retrieval queries
- `text_model.py`: LSTM model to extract text features
- `img_text_composition_models.py`: various image text compostion models 
- `torch_function.py`: contains soft triplet loss function and feature normalization function
- `test_retrieval.py`: functions to perform retrieval test and compute recall performance

## Running the experiments 

### Download the datasets
#### MITStates dataset

Download the dataset via this [link](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/Public/states_and_transformations/index.html) and save it in the ``data`` folder. Kindly take care that the dataset should have these files:

```data/processed/mitstates/images/<adj noun>/*.jpg```


#### Fashion200k dataset

Download the dataset via this [link](https://github.com/xthan/fashion-200k) and save it in the ``data`` folder.
To ensure fair comparison, we employ the same test queries as TIRG. They can be downloaded from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/image_retrieval_css/test_queries.txt). Kindly take care that the dataset should have these files:

```
data/processed/fashion200k/labels/*.txt
data/processed/fashion200k/women/<category>/<caption>/<id>/*.jpeg
data/processed/fashion200k/test_queries.txt`
```

#### FashionIQ dataset

Download the dataset via this [link](https://github.com/XiaoxiaoGuo/fashion-iq) and save it in the ``data`` folder.
The dataset consists of three non-overlapping subsets, namely `dress`, `top-tee` and `shirt`. 
We join the two annotations with the text ` and it` to get a description similar to a normal sentence a user might ask on an E-Com platform. 
Furthermore, we combine the train sets of all three categories to form a bigger training set and train a single model on it. 
Analogously, we also combine the validation sets to form a single validation set. 

## Running the Code

For training and testing new models, pass the appropriate arguments. 

For instance, for training original TIRG model on MITStates dataset run the following command:

```
python -W ignore  main.py --dataset=mitstates --dataset_path=../data/mitstates/  --model=tirg --loss=soft_triplet --learning_rate_decay_frequency=50000 --num_iters=160000 --weight_decay=5e-5 --comment=mitstates_tirg_original --log_dir ../logs/mitstates/
```

For training TIRG with BERT model on MITStates dataset run the following command:

```
python -W ignore  main.py --dataset=mitstates --dataset_path=../data/mitstates/  --model=tirg --loss=soft_triplet --learning_rate_decay_frequency=50000 --num_iters=160000 --weight_decay=5e-5 --comment=mitstates_tirg_bert --log_dir ../logs/mitstates/ --use_bert True
```

For training TIRG with complete text query on MITStates dataset run the following command:

```
python -W ignore  main.py --dataset=mitstates --dataset_path=../data/mitstates/  --model=tirg --loss=soft_triplet --learning_rate_decay_frequency=50000 --num_iters=160000 --weight_decay=5e-5 --comment=mitstates_tirg_complete_text_query --log_dir ../logs/mitstates/ --use_complete_text_query True 
```

For training ComposeAE model on Fashion200k dataset run the following command:

```
python -W ignore  main.py --dataset=fashion200k --dataset_path=../data/fashion200k/  --model=composeAE --loss=batch_based_classification --learning_rate_decay_frequency=50000 --num_iters=160000 --use_bert True --use_complete_text_query True --weight_decay=5e-5 --comment=fashion200k_composeAE --log_dir ../logs/fashion200k/
```

For training RealSpaceConcatAE (ComposeAE model but with Concatenation in Real Space) on FashionIQ dataset run the following command:

```
python -W ignore  main.py --dataset=fashionIQ --dataset_path=../data/fashionIQ/  --model=RealSpaceConcatAE --loss=batch_based_classification --learning_rate_decay_frequency=8000 --num_iters=100000 --use_bert True --use_complete_text_query True --comment=fashionIQ_RealSpaceConcatAE --log_dir ../logs/fashionIQ/
```

## Notes:
### Running the BERT model
We use pretrained BERT model for encoding the text query. 
Concretely, we employ BERT-as-service and use Uncased BERT-Base which outputs a 512-dimensional feature vector for a text query. 
Detailed instructions on how to use it, can be found [here](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service).
It is important to note that before running the training of the models, BERT-as-service should already be running in the background.

### Monitoring Performance via tensorboard
Run the following command for monitoring loss and retrieval performance of the models:

```tensorboard --logdir ./reports/fashion200k/ --port 8898```
